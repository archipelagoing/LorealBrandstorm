# TENUE

## Visual Identity System

---

# 1. Core Brand Essence

TENUE represents persistence of presence.

Not the moment of application, but the trace that remains.

Everything in the visual system must feel:

* quiet
* intimate
* suspended
* luminous
* restrained

TENUE is never loud.

TENUE reveals itself slowly.

---

# 2. Logo System

## Primary Logo (Wordmark)

```
TENUE
```

Typography characteristics:

* high-fashion serif
* thin to medium stroke contrast
* elegant, not ornamental
* wide letter spacing

Letter spacing example:

```
T E N U E
```

Spacing communicates air and persistence.

Never condense.

Always allow breathing room.

---

## Recommended Fonts (free and paid options)

Closest free option:

* Playfair Display

Better paid options (ideal):

* Canela
* Didot
* Editorial New
* Saol Display

Use uppercase only for logo.

---

## Secondary Logo Symbol

Symbol concept: suspended droplet

Shape characteristics:

* elongated oval, not perfect circle
* slightly asymmetrical
* feels organic, not geometric

Optional variant:

droplet intersected by faint silk thread line

This represents identity intersecting network.

Never use heavy outlines.

Use subtle fill.

---

# 3. Color System

Midnight

Avoid pure white (#FFFFFF) and pure black (#000000).

Luxury lives in softness.

---

# 4. Texture System

TENUE relies heavily on texture rather than graphic elements.

Primary textures:

* dew droplets
* silk threads
* translucent diffusion
* glass surfaces
* skin

These textures communicate identity persistence.

Never use flat graphic fills alone.

Always combine with physical texture.

---

# 5. Photography Direction

TENUE imagery must feel editorial, not commercial.

Subjects:

* suspended droplets
* spiderweb dew structures
* silk in motion
* collarbone and neck skin
* perfume bottles in shadow
* diffusion in air

Lighting:

* soft directional light
* moonlight simulation
* gentle highlights
* no harsh shadows

Background:

* soft darkness
* mist
* neutral surfaces

Never use bright studio lighting.

---

# 6. Layout System

TENUE layouts use negative space generously.

Structure example:

```
[ large empty space ]

TENUE

[ subtle image ]

[ minimal text ]
```

Text never crowds image.

Image never crowds frame.

Everything breathes.

---

# 7. UI Visual System (for app / prototype)

Background:

Pearl or Midnight

Text:

Champagne or Moonlight Silver

Interactive elements:

thin lines only

No heavy buttons.

Example button:

thin outline rectangle
champagne color
large padding

No filled bright buttons.

---

# 8. Animation Principles (important)

TENUE elements never move quickly.

Animation characteristics:

* slow fade in
* slow diffusion
* subtle shimmer

Examples:

droplet appearing slowly
text fading into existence
background diffusion emerging

No bounce animations.

No rapid transitions.

Everything feels persistent.

---

# 9. Brand Voice

Tone characteristics:

* quiet
* intimate
* observant
* restrained

Avoid:

* hype language
* tech language
* marketing exaggeration

Preferred phrases:

"presence remains"

"identity persists"

"trace connects"

"ownership becomes identity"

---

# 10. Example Homepage Layout

Top:

TENUE logo centered

Center image:

dew-covered silk thread structure

Below:

"Identity persists."

Button:

Enter Tenue

Minimal.

---

# 11. Conceptual Symbol Hierarchy

Primary symbol:
droplet

Secondary symbol:
thread

Combined symbol:
droplet resting on thread

This is the complete conceptual model of TENUE.

---

# 12. What TENUE Should Never Look Like

Never:

* neon colors
* gradients that feel techy
* sharp geometric icons
* corporate UI elements
* startup-style branding

TENUE is not software.

TENUE is presence.

---

# 13. One-Sentence Visual Definition

TENUE looks like moonlight revealing dew suspended on silk.
